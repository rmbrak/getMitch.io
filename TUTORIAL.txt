1. Click Green Button (Clone or Download)
	- Download ZIP

2. Create repository
	- Name it (something).github.io
	- Scroll down, click initialize with README
3. Extract the ZIP file to a new folder on your desktop or wherever, just remember where it's saved

4. Replace images in the Folder
	- Open that folder, and go to the "img" folder
	- Delete all the photos, replace them with your own
	- Make sure the photos have a simple name (something like "img-2126665236-dsiagfvsga-617124628-1.png" is too long

4a. Make a new Icon (OPTIONAL, BUT RECCOMENDED)
	- Go to "icoconverter.com"
	- Follow the steps to create an icon, don't change any settings
		- an icon is the little image that appears on the tab when you go to a website. On GetSLHS, if you
		  look at the tab, it has an SL. This will let you change that image.
	- After you've created the icon, it will automatically save to your downloads file
	- Find it in the downloads, copy it, then paste it into the folder with the code
		- If the icon file is not named "favicon.ico" change it to that. It will ask if you want to replace the 
	 	  current file with that name, say yes
		- If the icon is named "favicon", it will still ask if you want to replace the file, say yes

5. Upload Files
	- Go back to the repository on GitHub, click upload files
	- Select all the files in the folder onto GitHub and it will upload and organize the files for you
	- Don't just drag the folder, open the folder and select the files
	- Scroll down and click commit changes

6. Replace Images in the Code
	- after the files have loaded, go back to the code tab in GitHub, Open Styles folder
	- Open Main.css
	- Click the pen icon in the top right corner to edit
	- Scroll down to line 329
	- replace "annandale.png" to the new file name
	- repeat all the way down until all images are replaced, then scroll down and click "Commit Changes" 

7. Test the website
	- After the files have loaded, click settings and scroll down to Pages
	- In the Source section, click the drop down menu and select "master branch"
	- The page will refresh, just scroll down to the Source again
	- it should have a green check mark and say "Your Website is published at..."
		- If it doesn't, wait a couple minutes, refresh, try again
	- Click the link to make sure it works

8. Edit the HTML
	- Scroll to the top of the page, click the "Code" tab
	- Open the file that says "index.html" and copy the text
	- Open "https://html-online.com/editor/" and paste the text into the box on the right
	- Scroll down to where you can see and understand the text, replace it with whatever you want.
		- If you can't figure this step out, find someone who can, follow a tutorial,
		  or come ask me, Rei Linam, to help you out
	- Don't worry that it doesn't look exactly like the game, it's not supposed to
		- it's just supposed to change the text that comes up on the website
	- After you've edited it how you like, copy it from the html editor website, go to the "index.html" on GitHub
		- Make sure you're in edit mode
 	- Highlight all the text and paste what you copied from the html editor website
	- Scroll down and click "Commit Changes"

NOTE: Sometimes it can take a while for the website to be updated, so if the changes aren't live immediately, don't panic,
just wait a little while and refresh the website

Hopyfully the website has the pictures you want on it, it functions correctly, and the text around the game is right.
I suggest you test the game out and make sure that each tile has an image. The best way to test is to right click, 
inspect,
and click the sideways arrow next to the line that says "div class= tile container".
Then double click one of the lines that says "tile tile-2..." and change the first 2 to 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., 
making sure the pictures come up and look the way you want them to.

If the pictures don't look right, my best suggestion is to open the folder that you extracted the ZIP file from and open
the "index.html" file, which will open the website, but as a file. Only you can access that file.
Open the img folder, and 
edit the images in paint, 
constantly refresh the html page to make sure they look right.
Once that's all done, go back to the GitHub page, 
open the img folder, 
click upload files, 
drag JUST THE IMAGES onto the site, 
scroll down and click "Commit Changes".

If you've successfully reached this point, it means that you have made your own version of GetSLHS, which is a copy of
GetMIT!, which is a copy of 2048. Now you may, or may not, have noticed that the colors of the text don't match the
images in the game. This step is optional, some of you don't care what the colors are, but some of you may and this is
how you can fix it. It may be complicated, so I'll do my best to explain in a way that you can all understand.

1. Change Colors in "main.css"
	- Go to the Code tab in GitHub
	- open the styles folder
	- open main.css file
	- scroll down to line 24 and change the "#4169E1" to another color. 
		- Google "Hex color picker", 
		  play around until you find the color you like, 
		  copy the number under the color box, it should have a # in front
		  go back to the main.css file in GitHub, and
		  paste it where the old number with the # in front of it is

		  DO NOT REMOVE OR REPLACE ANYTHING ELSE, JUST REPLACE THE NUMBERS

		- This line edits the color of the Title of the page. Like how GetSLHS is blue, it will change it
		  to whatever color you want

	- scroll down to line 111 and repeat the same process above
		- this line changes the color of the hyperlink text, like on GetSLHS, if you scroll below the game, 
		  there are links that are green. Changing this will change what color they appear as. 

	- scroll down to line 128 and repeat the same process above.
		- this line changes the small line at the top of the screen. On GetSLHS, it is green, but you can change it
		  to whatever you'd like.

After you've done this, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Commit Changes". Open your website to make sure
it looks the way you'd like it to, again, changes don't go up immediately, it can a few minutes, just give it some time,
refresh the page often, and it'll all be working just fine.

If you've made it this far and everything looks great, you're done! 

My final suggestion, and this is not only for you to see how many people are playing your game, but so that you don't
have to give out a really long url to people when they ask what the name of the website is.
I suggest that you go to bitly.com, tinyurl.com, or any url shortening website, I personally use bitly the most. Follow
their instructions and soon you'll have a website that you can spread to everyone around you to let them play what you made.
